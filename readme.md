This is a simple, sample project to make demonstrating Boxtape easier.

The project itself has no dependencies on boxtape.

However, after cloning, you should be able to run:

```
boxtape up
```

Boxtape will analyse the project, detect the various server requirements (mysql, etc)
and build a vagrant box for you.
